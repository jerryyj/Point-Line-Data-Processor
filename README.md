# Point-Line-Data-Processor
This application reads in data records describing points or lines. When displaying data, all duplicate records are removed and the data can be displayed according to certain sorting criterias. A "cleaned" version of the input file can also be generated and outputted which removes all duplicate records.

Steps to run the application:
1) Clone the repository
2) Compile LPDP.cpp using any C++ compiler
3) Run the compiled application

A input text file 'input.txt' containing sample point and line data is provided for testing purposes
